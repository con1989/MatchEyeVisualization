# MatchEyeVisualization
Regarding the implementation, and since it was decided that
the output will be in a form of a website an attempt was
made to build the output with the use of HTML5, CSS3 and
JavaScript. The main reason that this approach takes place is
the fact that the users would be able to visit the visualization
easily then using their own web browser, without needing to
install additional software, because these technologies run on
client side and are more friendly to the web browsers.
For the data visualization, the D3.js library is used as, it
is mentioned in the assignment document. Since, this library
allows the user to handle data in JavaScript in a very simple
and easy way, by binding the data to nodes in the DOM. This
library offers a huge set of default visualization techniques and
simulations.
